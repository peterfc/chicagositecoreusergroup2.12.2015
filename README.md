Presentation at the Sitecore User Group in Chicago at AmericanEagle.com on 2.12.2015

In the root of this repo is a Sitecore package you can install. 
It'll have all the data - the Home page, the Data folder and the View Data folder, along with the rendering items and templates.

You'll need to create/use your own Data folder in the file system - add your license, etc.

Other than that, you should be able to stand up an instance of my project with everything here. 

If you have any problems or questions, please let me know.
